<#
.SYNOPSIS
Builds the shadcn registry and publishes it to https://design.danielmiller.ca/r/.

.DESCRIPTION
Apps install from https://design.danielmiller.ca/r/{name}.json, which serves the Cloudflare R2
bucket `design`. This runs `npm run build:registry` to write public/r/, then uploads every file
there to r/<name>.json in the bucket. Uploads overwrite, so running it twice is harmless.

Needs wrangler signed in to the Cloudflare account that owns the bucket: `npx wrangler@4 login`.
